					<h2>What do your BMI results mean?</h2>
					<p>
						A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
						Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing
						health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for
						a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating
						ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular
						physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a
						week.

						<h3>Limitations of BMI</h3>
						<p>
							Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it
							is not suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully
							consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement
							may not be beneficial to use.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="grid-item grid-item-1">
						<div class="effects-header">
							<div class="image"></div>
							<h3>Gender</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary
							with age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered
							when evaluating their BMI.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="grid-item grid-item-3">
						<div class="effects-header">
							<div class="image"></div>
							<h3>Age</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause
							BMI to underestimate body fat content.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="grid-item grid-item-4">
						<div class="effects-header">
							<div class="image"></div>
							<h3>Muscle</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese,
							as it doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="grid-item grid-item-5">
						<div class="effects-header">
							<div class="image"></div>
							<h3>Pregnancy</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing
							baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to
							minimise health risks for both mother and child.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="grid-item grid-item-6">
						<div class="effects-header">
							<div class="image"></div>
							<h3>Race</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and
							Asian origins at lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is
							advised to discuss this with your GP or practice nurse.
